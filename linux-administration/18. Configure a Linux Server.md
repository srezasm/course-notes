### SSH pub key authentication
1. create a new ssh key:
	`$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "[comment]"`
	the private and public keys are created in `~/.ssh` dir by default.

2. authorize the public key to the server:
	`$ ssh-copy-id [username]@[ip]`
	after that, the public key is added to server at `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

3. disable pass auth in server
	set the `PasswordAuthentication` to `no` at `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`

4. restart the ssh service
	`$ systemctl restart ssh
