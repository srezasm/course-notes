## key generation
`$ ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -C "comment"`
	`-b` length of key in bits. 2048 is usually sufficient.
	`-t` key type. the `rsa` is the most common.
	`-C` comment
it will also ask for a password to encrypt the private key.

the public and private key pairs will be created in `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

## paring the client and server
to authorize a public key, add it to `~/.ssh/known_hosts` manually or use following command: `$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@ip`

to debug the problems with ssh remote connection, use `-v` option for `ssh` command to see the connection logs.

## disabling password authentication
in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` change `PasswordAuthentication` to `no`
restart the server with `systemctl restart ssh`
